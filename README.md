# BlogSite

Asp is a blog site written using .net MVC Framework. Entitiy technology, an ORM tool, was used.
MsSql is used in the database.

I created the blog site to share the new technologies I learned in the field of software, the solution of the errors
I encountered and the articles I liked.

An Admin Panel has been created for adding a new blog to the blog site, updating a blog, deleting a blog, 
viewing and deleting comments made to blogs.
